# GSvsTSLA
Comparison between Gamestop and Tesla securities using webscrapping, through Jupyter,Python,and Finance method.

I did import an unnatural amount of libraries for this simple stock comparison, but mainly because I was playing around with a lot of different 
techniques. 

I have here the historical price of Tesla and Gamestop over the last 10 years, along with their closing price movement throughout that time.

Traditionally, an increase in Revenue also shows an increase in price. But when we take a look at Gamestop, there seems to be more at play.
Although I only show the Revenue and Price graphs, it is known that both of these stocks were heavily shorted leading up until 2021, 
(and beyond), when both stocks showed a massive increase in their Price action. Retail alone can not account for the mechanisms that took place
during 2021, when a big chunck of securities had massive gains. Gamestop garnished the most attention, since the stock showed 
a short percentage of over 200%. Perhaps another visual for another time. This code shows my method to showing how disconnected from profits/price
Gamestop seems to be, while Tesla follows a more traditional sense for its price action.
